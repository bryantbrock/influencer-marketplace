## Why this repo?

If a particular business idea where to fruition into a full scale software project, this would house the meat of the project. It most likely would turn into the API, and we would build out separate clients for the web and mobile versions of the app.

Additionally, this repo exists as a template upon which any backend, Model Driven Application can draw from a boilerplate with Typscript, Node, Eslint, formatting on save, and jest TDD (if so desired). It has great potential.
